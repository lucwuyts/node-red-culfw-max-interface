Experiment to control MAX! eQ-3 devices linked with a culfw device

The products from eQ-3 https://www.eq-3.com/start.html are working very well.
I used to control them from my node-red application by sending messages to the MAX! Cube Lan gateway https://www.eq-3.com/products/homematic/detail/max-cube-lan-gateway.html

Recently i found out about alternative firmware for the Cube.
culfw http://culfw.de
You can run this firmware on a variety of devices, and you are able to control more than only the MAX! devices. (But i think, you need more than 1 culfw device to control different products)

Since i had a MAX! Cube box too much, i decided to flash this with the culfw firmware and start playing with it.
I followed this guide to flash it: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/converting-a-max-cube-to-cul-cun-to-use-with-home-assistant/74218
